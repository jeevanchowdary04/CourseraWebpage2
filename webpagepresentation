# Introduction

Welcome to my interactive Plotly visualization! In this webpage, I will display a plot created using the `plotly` package in R.

The plot below shows a simple scatter plot created using random data points.

# Interactive Plot

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(plotly)

# Create a sample data frame with random data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100),
  category = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Create a Plotly scatter plot
plot <- plot_ly(data, x = ~x, y = ~y, color = ~category, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Random Scatter Plot with Plotly",
         xaxis = list(title = "X Axis"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Y Axis"))

# Display the plot
